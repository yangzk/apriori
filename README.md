# apriori
This Apriori Algorithm is based on the work of Nathan Magnus (http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~dbd/cs831/notes/itemsets/itemset_prog1.html). I modified the parts such that is generates a JSON file where all the nodes generated and pruned during the process are explicitly recorded. The data is then used as an input to visualize the algorithm (https://github.com/yangzk/Apriori-Visualization) itself. 

Input: config.txt
	   transa.txt

Output: test.json


The folder contains four different datast to test (http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~dbd/cs831/notes/itemsets/datasets.php). You can use the datasets to replace the two input files.
